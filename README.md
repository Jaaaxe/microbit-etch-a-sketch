# Microbit Etch A Sketch

## What is an Etch A Sketch?
An Etch A Sketch is a toy invented in the 1960s An Etch A Sketch has a thick,\
flat gray screen in a red plastic frame. There are two white knobs on the front\
of the frame in the lower corners. Twisting the knobs moves a stylus that\
displaces aluminum powder on the back of the screen, leaving a solid line. \
The knobs create lineographic images.

## How does the game work on the microbit?
The microbit has a 5x5 led display which allows users to move a *pixel* using\
the button A for horizontal movement and button B for vertical movement.\
You can then set the pixel using the button combination of A+B. It allows\
the user to create pixel art and find out clever new ways in which they can\
create objects within the constraints of the 5x5 array of leds.

## Controls

**Button A**: Control the current pixel vertically. Press to move the pixel by one space.\
**Button B**: Control the current pixel horizontally. Press to move the pixel by one space.\
**Button A+B**: Set the pixel at its current position. A collection of *set pixels*\
                make up your pixel art.\
**Button Reset**: Clear your board using the reset button the back

## Warnings
Pressing the A+B input on the microbit isn't always registered due to how\
quickly the buttons need to be pressed. But art takes patience ;).
